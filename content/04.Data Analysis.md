## Exploratory Data Analysis

Five main tools were used to describe the dataset. 

**Scatterplots**

The reason for using scatter plots is to observe relationships between each pair of variables. Each dot in a scatter plot reports the values of individual data point, all the datapoints when plotted can help us identify a pattern that can show whether a relationship can be derived between two variables. This tool will help us decide which pairs of variables to explore further through other tools. Each pair of variables will have two plots. 

**Boxplots**

The reason for using box plots is to provide a visual summary of the data enabling us to visualize the median and range values, the dispersion of the data set, and any signs of skewness. So we can compare dispersion of new bike counts with respect to different values of a parameter. This tool will be used to explore certain relationships further than scatterplots, and not for all pairs of parameters. 
A box plot includes five values: the minimum value, the 25th percentile (Q1), the median, the 75th percentile (Q3), and the maximum value. 

**Multi-variable Point Plots** 

The reason multi-variable point plots are used is to shows us the effect of certain variables on the distribution of the new bike counts during the day. So we can obtain different plots depending on the other variable, so we can explore two variables interrelations. And we choose categorical variables to find how their different categories affect the change in new bike counts along a day. 

**Statistical Values**

The reason for finding statistical values is get an insight about the mean, range and maximum and minimum values of different parameters especially new bike counts, and make a connection with the visualizations created. If the dataset included more than 2 years, a good approach would have been to also find covariance between datapoints in different years to identify any change in pattern resulting from certain events associated with a certain year, but this is not needed in our case. 

**Correlation Matrix**

The reason for using correlation matrix is to identify correlation between all parameters in the dataset and the ones affecting new bike counts only. This is important for the predictive model, so we understand and interdependencies between predictors and to avoid multicollinearity. 
Correlation values range between -1 and 1., positive values indicate positive correlation and negative values indicate negative correlation.  Absolute Values above 0.7 generally indicate high positive correlation, between 0.5 and 0.7 is moderate and between 0.3 and 0.5 is low, while under 0.3 is negligible correlation. 

### Interpretation of EDA

**Scatterplots** 

By looking at the plots we observe the following:
- 1- t1 and t2 are linearily dependent, which is expected because temperature feel directly depends on temperature.
- 2- Wind_speed and t2 seem to have some kind of relationship, which needs to be explored further
- 3- t1 and t2 have some kind of relationship with humidity, which needs to be explored further.
- 4- t1, t2, humidity and wind speed have some kind of relationship with cnt, which needs to be - explored further.
- 5 - Weather code and cnt have some kind of relationship.
- 6- Cnt seems higher when is_holiday is 0 (so when it is not a holiday)
- 7- Cnt seems higher when is_weekend is 0 (so during weekdays)
- 8- Cnt seems higher for weather codes (0-9)
- 9- Cnt seems higher for season 1 (summer), then similar for seasons 0 and 2 and lowest for season 3 (winter). 
- 10- Cnt seems highest for month 7,9,8,5 (expected based on observation 9)
- 11- It doesn't seem a certain pattern can be derived for effect of day on cnt. 
- 12- Cnt seems to have a relation depending on hour that can be explored further and it seems to be a multi-peak distribution

The observations above allow us to build hypthesis that can be explored further using other EDA tools which will lay down the basis of our predictive model.

**Boxplots**

- Graph1 shows that: 
>  - 1- There seems to be a distribution of the median (middle line of the boxplot) and range (of the black line of each boxplot) of cnt with respect to month, it roughly follows a normal ditribution, peaking in July. 
>  - 2- For each month the distributions tends to be skewed to the right.
>  - 3- Months with lowest ranges are January, February, November and December. 
- Graph2 shows that:
>  - 1- There is no clear distribution of median of cnt over the hours of the day, but the variation shows that cnt varies between different hours in the day, which seems to have two peaks, around 8 am then around 5 pm. 
>  - 2- During some hours, the shape of the distribution of cnt tends to be normal, while it's more skewed to the right for some other hours. 
>  - 3- As expected night hours have the lowest cnt.
