## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Bike sharing system has appeared more and more on the street of the cities in order to meet the demand of public transportation in the last short distance to the destination.
Also, Bike sharing system is so popular around all the world that most of major modern cities and campuses have been operated. Among researches for the bike system, predicting the
demanding number of future bike shares is one of the most important and necessary tasks. During our project, the aim of this study is to create a predictive model for bike-sharing
counts in an hour in the city of London in United Kingdom. The model makes use of regular neural networks. And the main features affecting the bike counts include weather
conditions and time variables. The model's root mean square is 210, with a mean of 1124 counts in an hour for testing data compared to 1138 counts in an hour in the training data.
The model provides enough accuracy for planning the number of docks at a new station and scheduling bike redistribution schedules between stations.
